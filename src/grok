GOAL (A): streamline processing from noteon to emission
multiple mods can source from the same controller
multiple mods can feed the same generator
owning the generator can cause multiple copies. so don't do that
keep an array of generators
defer generator-processing till all mods are processed
start from the ground up; go backwards in the hierarchy since controllers access the bottom (mod) level.

controller owns array of indices to mods
process all mod indices 


is this copying values into the voice necessary? 


GROWING AN IDEA...
==================
controller array (controller 1 touches mods 0 and 1, 2 hits 5 and 52, etc.)
loop through and populate array of mod indices
mod array: {0 1 5 2 26 32 52 80}
affected gens: {23 256 1 12}


HOWEVER...
==========
note/key (NK) must be in preset range first
[NK] must be in each izone range second
if igen exists, set voice->gen[igen.genType] = igen. Else if globalIgen exists, do that instead.
controller changes don't matter if the note's not on, so start with noteon instead.
